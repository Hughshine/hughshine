Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Blessing on your day. 

I'm Xuyang Li, currently a 1st year PhD student working on formal methods at [Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering
, Purdue](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE). Feel free to chat with me at `li5274@purdue.edu`!

I research on formal methods and software engineering techiques.

For former projects, I worked on verified compilation (see [CompCert](https://github.com/AbsInt/CompCert)) and polyhedral compilation (see [Pluto](https://github.com/bondhugula/pluto)). I also know something about relaxed concurrency (see [compiler verification on Promising Semantics](https://plax-lab.github.io/publications/promisingcomp/)). I mechanize proofs with [Coq proof assistant](https://coq.inria.fr/).
