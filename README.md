Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Blessing on your day. 

I'm Xuyang Li, currently a graduate student majoring in computer science at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/). Feel free to chat with me at `xuyang.li at smail dot nju dot edu dot cn`!

I research on formal methods and software engineering techiques. I'm also interested in humanity (cultural aspects) and human-computer interface, creating functional and immersive softwares (or say, "art", :D) to support, expand and enrich human's perceptions and experiences within this universe.

For former projects, I've worked on verified compilation (see [CompCert](https://github.com/AbsInt/CompCert)) and polyhedral compilation (see [Pluto](https://github.com/bondhugula/pluto)). I also know something about relaxed concurrency (see [compiler verification on Promising Semantics](https://plax-lab.github.io/publications/promisingcomp/)). I mechanize proofs with [Coq proof assistant](https://coq.inria.fr/).

If you're interested, just drop by [my homepage](https://hughshine.github.io)!
