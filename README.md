Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Blessing on your day. 

Here's a person in computer science. Feel free to chat with me at `xuyang.li at smail dot nju dot edu dot cn`!

Academically, I'm working on CompCert now, specifically polyhedral model. Also interested in practical program analysis and formal method related techniques.

Alongside these, I'm accumulating SDE stack, to build & create wonderful and powerful tools to enrich man's life.

Personally, I hold the idea that, rationality is logically a tool to achieve deeper and clearer sensibility. I can't help to dwell in all detail things about human's experience. Ultimately, I may head for creating experiences in one or more means. Chat with me on these topics! 

Hopefully I will sort out some articles and restart my blogging these days :D
